# Indygo On-Time Performance Analysis
This On-Time Performance Dashboard in PowerBI will focus on analyzing service reliability by measuring the percentage of trips operating within a specified threshold of their scheduled time. It will provide insights into OTP trends across timeframes, route categories, and individual routes, serving as a cornerstone of the broader open data vision.

**Business Questions – On time Performance**

- What is the overall monthly on-time performance by day of service (Weekday, Saturday, Sunday )?
- How does OTP vary across different route categories - service frequency, rapid transit)?
- What is the OTP trend for specific routes over the past 12 months?
- How does OTP change across different time frames (e.g., monthly, by bid period, or over the last five weeks)?
- What is the change in OTP by month, year, or week?
- How does OTP differ during peak vs. non-peak hours?

Information on dataset(s) to be used:

The dataset for this project is provided by IndyGo and is sourced from various electronic devices integrated into the transit system, such as GPS trackers and Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs).
The data is pre-processed to include only relevant fields and will be provided in a structured format to facilitate analysis and dashboard development.
